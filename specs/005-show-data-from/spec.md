# Feature Specification: Email Verification Data Display

**Feature Branch**: `005-show-data-from`
**Created**: September 17, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Show data from database where email_verification_status column has an entry. Make Supabase on the left side and HubSpot on the right side. Just 3 columns: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a CRM administrator, I want to view email verification data from both Supabase and HubSpot side-by-side so that I can compare and verify the synchronization status of email verification information between the two systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the email verification data display page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see Supabase data on the left side and HubSpot data on the right side
2. **Given** I am viewing the data display, **When** I look at the columns, **Then** I should only see three columns: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status
3. **Given** I am viewing the Supabase data, **When** I look at the records, **Then** I should only see records where the email_verification_status column has a value (is not null or empty)
4. **Given** I am viewing the HubSpot data, **When** I look at the records, **Then** I should see corresponding records matched by hs_object_id
5. **Given** I am comparing data between systems, **When** I look at matching records, **Then** I should be able to easily identify any discrepancies in email_verification_status values

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Supabase record has an hs_object_id that doesn't exist in HubSpot?
- How does the system handle records where email_verification_status is an empty string vs null?
- What happens when there are multiple Supabase records with the same hs_object_id?
- How does the system handle records where the name field is missing or empty?
- What happens when the page loads and there are no records with email_verification_status values?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display email verification data in a side-by-side layout with Supabase on the left and HubSpot on the right
- **FR-002**: System MUST show only three columns for each data source: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter Supabase records to show only those where email_verification_status column has a non-null, non-empty value
- **FR-004**: System MUST match HubSpot records to Supabase records using the hs_object_id field
- **FR-005**: System MUST display records in a tabular format that allows easy comparison between the two data sources
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where matching HubSpot records are not found for Supabase hs_object_id values
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the data in a user-friendly format that highlights any discrepancies between email_verification_status values

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Supabase Contact Record**: Represents a contact in the internal database with email verification status information, including name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status fields
- **HubSpot Contact Record**: Represents the corresponding contact in HubSpot CRM system, matched by hs_object_id, containing the same three fields for comparison
