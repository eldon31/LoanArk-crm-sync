# Feature Specification: Add HubSpot Database and Contacts Pages

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add new 2 pages the app , The first website will be just the hubspot database with all the column base on this column name below:
(case sensitive)
hs_object_id
email
email_verification_status
firstname
lastname
phone
mobilephone
client_type_vip_status
client_type_prospects

client_type_prospects
address
city

lastmodifieddate"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of the CRM sync app, I want to view HubSpot data in two separate pages: one showing the synced database records and another showing live contacts from HubSpot, both displaying specific contact properties including identification, contact details, client types, address information, and timestamps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I navigate to the HubSpot database page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a table displaying all synced HubSpot records with the specified columns: hs_object_id, email, email_verification_status, firstname, lastname, phone, mobilephone, client_type_vip_status, client_type_prospects, address, city, zip, createdate, lastmodifieddate
2. **Given** I navigate to the HubSpot contacts page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a table displaying all live HubSpot contacts with the specified properties: hs_object_id, email, email_verification_status, firstname, lastname, phone, mobilephone, client_type_vip_status, client_type_prospects, address, city, zip, createdate, lastmodifieddate

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no records/contacts to display?
- How does the system handle API failures when fetching HubSpot data?
- What if some contacts are missing certain properties?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a page displaying synced HubSpot database records in a table format with columns: hs_object_id, email, email_verification_status, firstname, lastname, phone, mobilephone, client_type_vip_status, client_type_prospects, address, city, zip, createdate, lastmodifieddate
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a page displaying live HubSpot contacts in a table format with properties: hs_object_id, email, email_verification_status, firstname, lastname, phone, mobilephone, client_type_vip_status, client_type_prospects, address, city, zip, createdate, lastmodifieddate
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure column/property names are case-sensitive as specified
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle cases where data may be missing or incomplete for some records/contacts

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **HubSpot Contact**: Represents a contact record with properties including unique identifier (hs_object_id), email information, personal details (firstname, lastname), phone numbers, client type classifications, address components, and timestamp fields (createdate, lastmodifieddate)
