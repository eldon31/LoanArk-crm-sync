# Feature Specification: Fix Data Population Issue

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-data-population`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix data population issue in Email Verification Sync page - currently shows 'No email verification records found' instead of displaying two tables (Supabase and HubSpot data) with email verification records"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description provided: Fix data population issue
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: Email Verification Sync page, data population problem, two tables needed (Supabase + HubSpot)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Data source connection details [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How to connect to Supabase and HubSpot?]
   ‚Üí Authentication requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What auth is needed to access the data?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified: User expects to see data tables but sees empty state
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Requirements focus on data display functionality
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Email verification records from both systems
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user managing email verification data, I want to see both Supabase and HubSpot data displayed in separate tables on the Email Verification Sync page, so that I can compare and sync email verification statuses between the two systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user navigates to Email Verification Sync page, **When** there are email verification records in Supabase, **Then** Supabase table displays the records with name, HubSpot ID, and verification status
2. **Given** user navigates to Email Verification Sync page, **When** there are matching HubSpot contacts, **Then** HubSpot table displays the contacts with name, HubSpot ID, and verification status
3. **Given** user navigates to Email Verification Sync page, **When** no email verification records exist, **Then** both tables show appropriate empty states instead of generic "No records found"
4. **Given** user has access to both systems, **When** page loads, **Then** data appears within 3 seconds of page load

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Supabase has records but HubSpot matching fails?
- How does system handle when user lacks permissions to access one or both data sources?
- What happens when there are connectivity issues to either Supabase or HubSpot?
- How does system behave when there are thousands of records to display?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display Supabase email verification records in a dedicated table showing name, HubSpot object ID, and verification status
- **FR-002**: System MUST display HubSpot contact records in a separate table showing name, HubSpot object ID, and verification status
- **FR-003**: System MUST match Supabase and HubSpot records using HubSpot object ID for side-by-side comparison
- **FR-004**: System MUST show appropriate loading states while fetching data from both sources
- **FR-005**: System MUST display meaningful empty states when no data is available in either table
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle and display error states when data cannot be retrieved from either source
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh data automatically or provide manual refresh capability
- **FR-008**: System MUST load data within 3 seconds of page navigation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is 3 seconds acceptable performance target?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Email Verification Record**: Represents a contact with email verification status from Supabase, containing name, email, verification status, and HubSpot object ID
- **HubSpot Contact**: Represents a contact from HubSpot CRM, containing name, email, verification status, and HubSpot object ID
- **Data Match**: Relationship between Supabase record and HubSpot contact using HubSpot object ID for synchronization
