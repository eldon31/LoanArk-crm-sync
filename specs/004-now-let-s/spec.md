# Feature Specification: Email Verification Status Sync

**Feature Branch**: `004-now-let-s`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "now let's create another webpage that will send data from supabase to hubspot. Now gather all the data if there's an entry or is not null in the column of supabase "email_verification_status" now in hubspot there is also a internal name called "email_verification_status" and it is a dropdown select. All the entries of supabase has been carefuly selected to also have the same internal name of the dropdrown select option. List down all from supabase then find their corresponding duplicate using the column hs_object_id of supabase. So it will have a button which will populate the entry of that specific corresponding duplicate to the hubspot's property internal name "email_verification_status""

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a CRM administrator, I want to sync email verification status data from Supabase to HubSpot so that contact records in HubSpot are updated with the latest verification status information from our internal database.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the email verification sync webpage, **When** I view the list of Supabase records with email verification status, **Then** I should see all records where email_verification_status is not null
2. **Given** I have a Supabase record with email_verification_status and hs_object_id, **When** I click the sync button for that record, **Then** the corresponding HubSpot contact should be updated with the email verification status
3. **Given** a Supabase record has an invalid hs_object_id, **When** I attempt to sync it, **Then** I should receive a clear error message indicating the sync failed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the HubSpot contact no longer exists?
- How does the system handle multiple Supabase records with the same hs_object_id?
- What happens when the email_verification_status value doesn't match any HubSpot dropdown option?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during sync?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a webpage that lists all Supabase records where email_verification_status is not null
- **FR-002**: System MUST show the email_verification_status value for each listed record
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the hs_object_id for each record to identify the corresponding HubSpot contact
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a button for each record to initiate the sync to HubSpot
- **FR-005**: System MUST update the HubSpot contact's email_verification_status property when the sync button is clicked
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that the email_verification_status value matches a valid HubSpot dropdown option before syncing
- **FR-007**: System MUST display success/failure status for each sync operation
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle and display appropriate error messages for failed sync operations

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Supabase Contact Record**: Represents a contact in the internal database with email_verification_status and hs_object_id
- **HubSpot Contact**: Represents the corresponding contact in HubSpot CRM with email_verification_status property
- **Sync Operation**: Represents the process of updating HubSpot with data from Supabase
