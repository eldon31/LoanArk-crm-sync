# Phase 0: Research & Analysis

## Research Findings

### HubSpot API Integration

**Decision**: Use HubSpot CRM API v3 with OAuth 2.0 authentication
**Rationale**: Latest stable API version with comprehensive contact management, OAuth provides secure token-based authentication
**Alternatives Considered**: API v1 (deprecated), Private App tokens (less secure for production)

### Real-Time Synchronization

**Decision**: Implement polling-based sync with configurable intervals
**Rationale**: Balances real-time requirements with API rate limits, allows for error recovery and backoff strategies
**Alternatives Considered**: Webhooks (complex setup), streaming API (not available in HubSpot)

### Data Consistency Strategy

**Decision**: Use optimistic locking with conflict resolution
**Rationale**: Prevents data loss during concurrent updates, provides clear resolution paths for conflicts
**Alternatives Considered**: Last-write-wins (risk of data loss), manual conflict resolution (poor UX)

### State Management Architecture

**Decision**: React Query + Context API for server state, Context API for client state
**Rationale**: React Query provides excellent caching and synchronization, Context API sufficient for connection state
**Alternatives Considered**: Redux (overkill for this scope), Zustand (simpler but less mature)

### Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive error boundaries with retry mechanisms
**Rationale**: Provides graceful degradation, user feedback, and automatic recovery for transient failures
**Alternatives Considered**: Global error handler only (less granular), no retry logic (poor reliability)

### Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer caching (memory + localStorage + Supabase)
**Rationale**: Optimizes performance, reduces API calls, provides offline capability
**Alternatives Considered**: No caching (poor performance), external cache service (added complexity)

### Authentication Flow

**Decision**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for HubSpot, JWT for internal auth
**Rationale**: Industry standard security, prevents token interception, scalable session management
**Alternatives Considered**: API key only (less secure), Basic auth (deprecated)

### Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Normalized schema with audit logging
**Rationale**: Maintains data integrity, enables comprehensive tracking, supports future extensions
**Alternatives Considered**: Denormalized (faster queries but data inconsistency risks)

### UI Component Architecture

**Decision**: Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**: Accessible by default, customizable, consistent design system, excellent developer experience
**Alternatives Considered**: Material UI (less flexible), custom components (maintenance burden)

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Unit + Integration + E2E testing with React Testing Library
**Rationale**: Comprehensive coverage, maintains accessibility, tests user interactions effectively
**Alternatives Considered**: Enzyme (less modern), Cypress only (misses unit testing benefits)

### Deployment Architecture

**Decision**: Netlify for frontend/backend, Supabase for database
**Rationale**: Seamless integration, excellent developer experience, built-in scaling and security
**Alternatives Considered**: Vercel (similar but less database integration), AWS (more complex setup)

## Technical Specifications

### API Rate Limits

- HubSpot API: 100 requests per 10 seconds for OAuth apps
- Implementation: Exponential backoff, request queuing, batch operations

### Data Volume Estimates

- Initial sync: Up to 10,000 contacts
- Daily changes: 100-500 contact updates
- Storage requirements: ~50MB for 10k contacts with history

### Performance Benchmarks

- Initial load: < 3 seconds
- Contact search: < 1 second
- Sync operation: < 5 minutes for 1k contacts
- Memory usage: < 100MB for typical usage

### Security Requirements

- All API communications over HTTPS
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Regular security dependency updates
- Audit logging for all data operations

### Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement queuing and backoff strategies
2. **Data Consistency**: Use transactions and optimistic locking
3. **Authentication Security**: Regular token rotation and secure storage
4. **Network Reliability**: Offline support and retry mechanisms

### Monitoring Requirements

- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- API usage tracking
- User activity logging

### Backup and Recovery

- Database automated backups
- Configuration backup

- Data export capabilities

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. Set up development environment with all required services
2. Implement basic authentication flow
3. Create database schema with audit logging
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

### Future Considerations

1. Implement advanced conflict resolution
2. Add support for additional HubSpot objects
3. Consider GraphQL API for complex queries
4. Implement advanced caching strategies

### Success Metrics

- Sync success rate > 99%
- User-reported issues < 1 per week
- Performance benchmarks maintained
- Security incidents = 0
