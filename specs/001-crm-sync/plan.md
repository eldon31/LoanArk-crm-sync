# Implementation Plan: CRM Sync Implementation

**Branch**: `001-crm-sync` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: specs/001-crm-sync/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-crm-sync/spec.md`

## Execution Fl**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/tasks command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolvedmmand scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive CRM synchronization system for LoanArk that integrates with HubSpot CRM, providing real-time data sync, connection monitoring, and user-friendly dashboards.

**Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: < 2s UI response, < 5min sync for 1000 contacts, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: Mobile-responsive, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, HTTPS-only, < 500KB bundle
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 50 concurrent users, 10k+ contacts, real-time sync monitoring

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend + backend) - Option 2 selected due to React frontend with Netlify Functions backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_COMPLETED: tasks.md generated with 35 actionable implementation tasks_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- ✅ Loaded Phase 1 design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- ✅ Generated implementation tasks from API contracts
- ✅ Created database setup and migration tasks
- ✅ Generated frontend component development tasks
- ✅ Created integration and testing tasks
- ✅ Established task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities

**Task Categories**:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (5 tasks): Database schema, environment configuration
2. **Backend Development** (10 tasks): API endpoints, HubSpot integration, data processing
3. **Frontend Development** (10 tasks): UI components, state management, user interactions
4. **Integration Tasks** (5 tasks): API integration, error handling, authentication
5. **Testing Tasks** (3 tasks): Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
6. **Documentation & Deployment** (2 tasks): Documentation completion and production deployment

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Infrastructure first (database, environment)
- Backend development (APIs, services)
- Frontend development (UI, components)
- Integration and testing (end-to-end validation)
- Documentation and deployment preparation

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:

- [P] Database schema creation and API development
- [P] Frontend component development and backend service implementation
- [P] Unit test creation and integration test development
- [P] Documentation writing and deployment preparation

**Actual Output**: 35 numbered tasks with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies, and time estimates

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
