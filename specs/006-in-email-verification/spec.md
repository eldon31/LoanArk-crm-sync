# Feature Specification: Email Verification Sync Data Display

**Feature Branch**: `006-in-email-verification`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "in email verification sync. It should show the data from database which the column email_verification_status has an entry. make the supabase in the left side while hubspot in the right side. just 3 column , the name , hs_object_id , and email_verification_status"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user managing email verification data, I want to view a side-by-side comparison of contact data from Supabase and HubSpot systems, specifically focusing on records that have email verification status entries, so that I can easily identify and manage email verification data across both platforms.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I access the email verification sync page, **When** the system loads data, **Then** I should see only records where the email_verification_status column has an entry
2. **Given** I view the data display, **When** I look at the layout, **Then** Supabase data should appear on the left side and HubSpot data on the right side
3. **Given** I view the data table, **When** I examine the columns, **Then** I should see exactly 3 columns: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status
4. **Given** I have records with email verification status, **When** the system displays data, **Then** all records with email_verification_status entries should be visible
5. **Given** I have records without email verification status, **When** the system loads, **Then** those records should not be displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no records with email_verification_status entries?
- How does the system handle records that exist in one system but not the other?
- What happens when email_verification_status values are inconsistent between systems?
- How does the system behave when there are a large number of records to display?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display only contact records where the email_verification_status column has an entry
- **FR-002**: System MUST show Supabase data on the left side of the display
- **FR-003**: System MUST show HubSpot data on the right side of the display
- **FR-004**: System MUST display exactly 3 columns: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status
- **FR-005**: System MUST synchronize and display data from both Supabase and HubSpot databases
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where records exist in one system but not the other [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should missing records be displayed?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear visual distinction between Supabase and HubSpot data sources
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure data accuracy and real-time synchronization between the two systems

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Contact Record**: Represents a person/contact with email verification data, containing name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status attributes
- **Email Verification Status**: Represents the verification state of an email address, stored in the email_verification_status column
- **Data Source**: Represents either Supabase or HubSpot system as the origin of the contact data
