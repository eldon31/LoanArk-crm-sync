# Implementation Plan: Email Verification Sync Data Display

**Feature**: `006-in-email-verification`
**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Status**: Planning Phase

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Create a data display feature for email verification sync that shows contact records with email verification status entries, comparing Supabase and HubSpot data side-by-side with exactly 3 columns: name, hs_object_id, and email_verification_status.

## 📋 Requirements Summary

- Display only records where `email_verification_status` column has entries
- Supabase data on left side, HubSpot data on right side
- Exactly 3 columns: name, hs_object_id, email_verification_status
- Real-time synchronization between systems
- Handle missing records gracefully

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Current)
- [ ] Analyze existing data structures in Supabase and HubSpot
- [ ] Review current API endpoints and data flow
- [ ] Identify data synchronization patterns
- [ ] Assess existing UI components for reuse

### Phase 2: API Development
- [ ] Create endpoint to fetch email verification records from Supabase
- [ ] Create endpoint to fetch corresponding HubSpot contact data
- [ ] Implement data matching logic using hs_object_id
- [ ] Add filtering for records with email_verification_status entries

### Phase 3: Component Development
- [ ] Create EmailVerificationSyncDisplay component
- [ ] Implement side-by-side layout (Supabase left, HubSpot right)
- [ ] Build data table with exactly 3 columns
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate with existing routing system
- [ ] Add to navigation menu
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Data Architecture
```
Supabase Contacts Table
├── id (primary key)
├── name
├── email
├── hs_object_id (foreign key to HubSpot)
├── email_verification_status
└── other fields...

HubSpot Contacts
├── id (hs_object_id)
├── properties.firstname
├── properties.lastname
├── properties.email
└── other properties...
```

### Component Structure
```
EmailVerificationSyncPage
├── EmailVerificationSyncDisplay
    ├── SupabaseDataTable (left side)
    │   ├── name
    │   ├── hs_object_id
    │   └── email_verification_status
    └── HubSpotDataTable (right side)
        ├── name
        ├── hs_object_id
        └── email_verification_status
```

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/email-verification-records` - Fetch Supabase records with email_verification_status
- `GET /api/hubspot-contacts/{hs_object_id}` - Fetch HubSpot contact data
- `GET /api/email-verification-sync` - Combined endpoint for side-by-side display

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Load Supabase Records**: Query contacts where email_verification_status IS NOT NULL
2. **Extract HubSpot IDs**: Get hs_object_id values from matching records
3. **Fetch HubSpot Data**: Query HubSpot API for corresponding contact data
4. **Match & Display**: Present data side-by-side with proper alignment
5. **Handle Missing Data**: Gracefully handle records that exist in one system but not the other

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Layout Design
- **Left Side (Supabase)**: Primary data source, full records
- **Right Side (HubSpot)**: Secondary data source, matching records
- **Column Alignment**: Ensure visual alignment between corresponding records
- **Visual Indicators**: Show data source, match status, and discrepancies

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side layout with full column visibility
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with horizontal scrolling
- **Mobile**: Single column with toggle between data sources

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Ensure proper authentication for data access
- [ ] Validate user permissions for email verification data
- [ ] Implement data sanitization for display
- [ ] Add audit logging for data access

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize API calls with batch requests
- [ ] Lazy loading for improved initial load time

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Only records with email_verification_status entries are displayed
- [ ] Supabase data appears on the left side
- [ ] HubSpot data appears on the right side
- [ ] Exactly 3 columns are shown: name, hs_object_id, email_verification_status
- [ ] Data is synchronized in real-time
- [ ] Missing records are handled gracefully

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Page loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Error handling for network failures
- [ ] Loading states for better user experience

## 🚧 Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Data Synchronization Issues**: Mitigated by implementing proper error handling and fallback displays
- **API Rate Limiting**: Mitigated by implementing caching and batch requests
- **Large Dataset Performance**: Mitigated by pagination and lazy loading

### Business Risks
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Mitigated by proper authentication and access controls
- **User Experience Issues**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing and user feedback

## 📅 Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Research)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 2 (API Development)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 3 (Component Development)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 4 (Integration & Testing)**: 2-3 days
- **Total Estimate**: 8-12 days

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Supabase contact data structure
- HubSpot API integration
- Authentication system
- UI component library

### External Dependencies
- HubSpot CRM API access
- Supabase database connectivity
- User permission system

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Complete Research Phase**: Analyze existing data structures and API patterns
2. **Create API Contracts**: Define expected request/response formats
3. **Design Component Interfaces**: Plan component props and state management
4. **Implement Core Functionality**: Build the basic data display feature
5. **Add Advanced Features**: Implement filtering, sorting, and export capabilities
