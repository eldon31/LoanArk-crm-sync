# Implementation Plan: Fix Contact Table Pagination and Loading

**Branch**: `003-description-the-next` | **Date**: September 17, 2025 | **Spec**: specs/003-description-the-next/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/0**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passediption-the-next/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Fix pagination controls and ensure complete contact data loading in both Supabase Database and HubSpot Contacts tables. The issue involves non-functional "Next" buttons and incomplete contact loading across table pages.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18
**Primary Dependencies**: React Query, TanStack Table, Radix UI
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), HubSpot API
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: UI response time < 2 seconds, API calls optimized with caching
**Constraints**: Bundle size < 500KB, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Support 50+ concurrent users, handle 1000+ contact records

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (frontend + backend detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Research current pagination implementation in TanStack Table
   - Investigate contact loading patterns in existing hooks
   - Analyze API pagination support in HubSpot and Supabase
   - Review existing error handling for pagination failures

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For pagination implementation:
     Task: "Research TanStack Table pagination patterns for React"
   For data loading:
     Task: "Analyze current useHubSpotContacts hook pagination support"
   For API integration:
     Task: "Review HubSpot API pagination parameters and limits"
   For performance:
     Task: "Research optimal page sizes for contact data loading"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Contact Record: existing entity with pagination metadata
   - Pagination State: page, limit, total, hasNext, hasPrevious
   - Table State: sorting, filtering, current page state

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Existing HubSpot contacts API with pagination parameters
   - Existing Supabase contacts API with pagination support
   - Update contracts to include pagination metadata

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test pagination parameters in API requests
   - Test pagination metadata in responses
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Pagination button functionality tests
   - Complete data loading verification tests
   - Cross-page data consistency tests

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot` for your AI assistant
   - Add pagination implementation details
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (parallel)
- Each pagination component → implementation task [P] (parallel)
- Each user story → integration test task
- Hook modifications → implementation task [P]
- Page component updates → implementation task [P]
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Contract tests first, then implementation
- Dependency order: API contracts before UI components
- Parallel execution: Mark [P] for independent files/tasks
- Sequential execution: Mark critical path items without [P]

**Task Categories**:

1. **Contract Tests** [P]: Validate API pagination behavior
2. **Hook Updates**: Modify useHubSpotContacts for server-side pagination
3. **Component Updates**: Update ContactsTable for manual pagination control
4. **Page Integration**: Connect pagination state between components
5. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pagination workflows
6. **Performance Tests**: Validate loading times and user experience

**Estimated Output**: 18-22 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

No constitution violations detected - implementation follows existing patterns and maintains all constitutional requirements.

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_
